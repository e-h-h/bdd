# How
  Files of each type should be stored in corresponding path, for example gimp sources in src/xcf and ready image in images/.jpg.
  
  Typically stickers should use english language as most common in Internet, but this is only preference. If you sure, that your sticker must be in different language it is OK. 
  
  You should save your image source in /src. In some cases it may be wery useful. It will be best if you could give us more than one file type. There is no restricted formats, but you should take care about licenses and other same problems by your own. 
  
  For Telegram sticker pack your sticker shoud be imported in .png with size 512 * 512 px. Note that stickers use only center of your file, 512 px diameter circle. template.* files in /src have such circle as primary layer.
  
  For general proposes, like physical stickers a or badges better use .jpg files. In printing companies this is preferable format, at least they say so. There is no strict rules but we suggest to use same size - 512 * 512 px.
